# Moop
  "Bot" (Command) that allows you to set time-zone & game roles, then filter based on active players that play the game in your Discord while in call. This command has been in development since 2017 and was the reason I got into Javascript, hopefully you find some use in its implementation.
<br>
## To install:
  In the file directory, in your terminal, run:
  `npm i`
<br>
## To use:
  1.) /roles (Set or choose roles for Time-Zone & Games)
<br>
  2.) /VC (Only works in call)
